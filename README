Solution to HITB 2017 CTF Crypto-100 challenge
==============================================

Challenge: find S such that for given P, M1(1), M2(1), M1(2), M2(2),
SHA1(P||M1(1)||M2(1)||S) == SHA1(P||M1(2)||M2(2)||S) and the last 32 bits of the hash are 0.

This is fairly easy: just brute force an S until the last 32 bits of the hash are 0.
